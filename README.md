# Structures
Fortran 2008 Structures Library
This is a library for different structures containing arbitrary data types using fortran 2003 class(*) type and fortran 2008 submodule features.
Currently this Project only contains a simple linked list with basic functionality and a test program which more or less explains the use of this lib.
